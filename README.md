# Bible

Originally [KJV](https://www.crosswire.org/~dmsmith/kjv2006/), in OSIS format, with various modifications. This retains the Strong's and morphology data from the original; some of the morphology data appears to be from Thayer's and is not freely available.

With debt and appreciation to James Jordan, Peter Leithart, and Duane Garner.

## Summary of changes

- Use Yah and Yahweh throughout the OT
- Use "exodus" in the NT for G1841
